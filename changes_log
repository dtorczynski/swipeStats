changes made:


-got rid of div ID to wrapper class because it was making the view drop down for some reason.

-removed jquery usage of hidding intro-text, and used angular's ng-hide by doing the following:

--deleted this from index.html (and it's associated query event in app.js):
        <div class="intro-text">
          <h1>Swipe left or right on each choice to play!</h1>
        </div>  
		
--added this into index.html:
		<div ng-hide="hideBool" class="ng-hide intro-text" ng-init="hideBool=false" ng-click="hideBool=true">
			<h1>Swipe left or right on each choice to play!</h1>
		</div>
		
	
-in index.html, removed the img tag from this, because it was putting the image lower in the page, which i thought there was no reason to (esp if ppl viewed this on a phone)
      
        .intro-text, h1 {
          position: absolute;     
          left: 0;
          right: 0;
          bottom: 0;
          margin: auto;
        }
